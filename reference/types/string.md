# String

## The Concept

A string is a sequence of [characters][type-char] (letters, digits, punctuation, etc.).

## What to cover

Tell a student what a string is in your language, how strings can be manipulated, and ensure they understand where to look for docs on strings.

- **Explain what strings are in your language?** Is it a sequence of bytes, UTF-8 characters or something else? Are strings objects or primitives?
- **How are strings brought together?** Do you join strings, add strings, concatenate strings, interpolate strings? It's worth giving a hint as to which is normal, or letting the user know all are ok!
- **How are strings split apart?** How do I extract a bit of a string?
- **Where do helper methods for strings live?** If I want to trim a string, or check it's length, how do I do that in your language? Are these string methods or functions that act on strings?

## Example Exercises

### Log Lines

This exercise covers joining, triming, case-changing, and substring extraction. It is a great exercise for covering the most basic elements of Strings, and ensuring a student finds the docs for strings.
