## General

- Ranges of integer and floating point types listed in [fundamental types][fundamental-types]
- Determining the success rate can be done through a [conditional statement][if-statement].
- C++ allows for multiplication to be applied to two different number types (such as an `int` and a `double`). It will automatically return the "largest" data type.
- Fixed-width integer types are listed in [fixed width integer types][fixed-width-integer-types].
- Information about types and how to acquire it during compilation is available via [numeric limits library][numeric-limits].
