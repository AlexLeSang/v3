# Concepts of Roman Numerals

This one is a bit of 'cheat' of an exericse - but the concept is real.

## Commentary

This is a *BIG* concept. While quite real, it may not be something to
get too deeply in too early. We might want to split this concept into
smaller pieces - such as the `A`, `S`, `W`, `D` directives then maybe
later more interesting versions of these (along with ones for
different radixes for numbers). Then later things like iteration and
conditional logic.
